In This DashBoard I have Analyse That There are 17 Type of Cancer Such as Lung Cancer,Ovary Cancer,Liver & Etc.
* Most of The Cancer Cases Founded in Womens:
   Womens = 51 %
   Men = 49 %
* There are Races Wise Cancer Cases:
   Black : 31.9 %
   White = 36.4 %
   All Races = 32 %
* I Also Analyse Year Wise Cancer Survival Rate,
  Deaths Rate By Cancer,Races By Survival,
  Cancer Rate By Gender,Survial Sample Test & Etc....



* This is Short Information About USA Cancer Survival Rate :-

     The survival rate for cancer in the United States varies depending on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as factors such as 
     the patient's age, overall health,and access to treatment.

     According to the American Cancer Society, the five-year relative survival rate for all cancers combined in the United 
     States is approximately 68%. This means that, on average, about 68% of people diagnosed with cancer are still alive 
     five years later. However, the survival rate can be much higher for certain types of cancer that are detected early and 
     treated effectively, such as breast and prostate cancer, with five-year relative survival rates of over 90% in many cases. 
     For other types of cancer, such as pancreatic and lung cancer, the five-year relative survival rates are much lower, 
     at around 10% and 18% respectively.

    It's important to note that these statistics are estimates and can't predict what will happen in a specific 
    individual's case. Advances in cancer treatment and early detection continue to improve cancer survival rates, 
    but the best way to increase your chances of surviving cancer is to get regular check-ups, follow a healthy lifestyle, 
    and seek prompt medical attention if you experience any symptoms that could be indicative of cancer.
